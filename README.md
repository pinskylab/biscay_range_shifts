Hi there, 
we have been exploring the effort of the data and this is how it looks. 
I've uploaded some spatial plots for common dolphin, per year and per year and month. And also, an excel file with the number of days that have been surveyed per month every year.
It seems that the systematic samplings start in 2002, which would reduce substantially the temporal range.
