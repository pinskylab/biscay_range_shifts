Hi there, 
we have been exploring the effort and this is how it looks. 
I've uploaded some spatial plots for common dolphin, per year and per year and month, where the black dots refer to effort and red dots to sightings. And also, an excel file with the number of days that have been surveyed per month every year.
It seems that the systematic samplings start in 2002, which would reduce substantially the temporal range. 

So, what do you think after looking at the data? Do you think that setting the start point in 2002 would be enough or should we include previous years despite the low effort? Should we do anything with months too?
