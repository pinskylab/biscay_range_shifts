Here you will find some preliminary results of the model obtained by "plot_results" function. As Jim suggested, this is a simple
model with no covariates, with both spatial and spatio-temporal variation and with years ranging from 1990 to 2018. 
Details on model configuration can be found in settings file.

Some notes:
> Diag--Encounter_prob: to check whether observed encounter frequencies are within the 95% predictive 
  interval for predicted encounter probability
> Effective area: range expansion/contraction
> Index biomass: changes in abundances. This plot needs to be readjusted, since we are not using catches but densities.
> Output aniso: I don't know how to interpret this.
> OutputDens: predictive densities per each year. It needs a legend, but I haven't figured out how to do it.
> Posterior predictive: diagnostic plot for convergence.
> Posterior predictive histogram: the distribution of the predictions. Not sure about its interpretation.
> Q-Q hist: the distribution of the quantiles
> Q-Q plot: diagnostic plot to check if the distribution of our data follows the assumed distribution.
> Center of gravity: changes in gravity center in West-East direction (left) and South-North (rigth).

Jim feel free to add additional notes.
