I have been exploring the effort and this is how it looks. 
I've uploaded some spatial plots for common dolphin, per year and per year and month, where the black dots refer to effort and red dots to sightings. And also, a file with the number of days that have been surveyed per month every year.
It seems that the systematic samplings start in 2002, which would reduce substantially the temporal range.
