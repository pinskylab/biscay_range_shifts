Those are the new results after having incoporated an autoregressive structure for spatiotemporal process as Jim suggested.
This allows VAST to estimate whether "hotspots" in population density typically persist from one year to the next (Thorson, 2019). 
However, by doing this the model was likely not converged (results can be found in non_converged folder). 
So, I also incorporated an autoregressive structure on intercepts, which will be useful when interpolating into years when data are not available.
The AIC for this model was lower than in previous two models (AIC values can be found in parameter estimation file).

The explanation for each plot remains as before:

> Diag--Encounter_prob: to check whether observed encounter frequencies are within the 95% predictive 
  interval for predicted encounter probability.
> Effective area: range expansion/contraction
> Index biomass: changes in abundances. This plot needs to be readjusted, since we are not using catches but densities.
> Output aniso: I don't know how to interpret this.
> OutputDens: predictive densities per each year. It needs a legend, but I haven't figured out how to do it.
> Posterior predictive: diagnostic plot for convergence.
> Posterior predictive histogram: the distribution of the predictions.
> Q-Q hist: the distribution of the quantiles.
> Q-Q plot: diagnostic plot to check if the distribution of our data follows the assumed distribution.
> Center of gravity: changes in gravity center in West-East direction (left) and South-North (rigth).

Details on model configuration can be found in parameter_estimation file and records.
