Model including NAO index. Since this is a variable that do not change over space, only over time, spatially varying effect 
was used (Thorson, 2019).

The model configuration can be checked in settings. 
The AIC can be checked in parameters estimates (Î”AIC smaller than 2).
For covariates, Xconfig_zcp[z,c,p]=3 was used.

The explanation for each plot remains as before:

> Diag--Encounter_prob: to check whether observed encounter frequencies are within the 95% predictive 
  interval for predicted encounter probability.
> Effective area: range expansion/contraction
> Index biomass: changes in abundances. This plot needs to be readjusted, since we are not using catches but densities.
> Output aniso: I don't know how to interpret this.
> OutputDens_legend: predictive densities per each year. 
> Posterior predictive: diagnostic plot for convergence.
> Posterior predictive histogram: the distribution of the predictions.
> Q-Q hist: the distribution of the quantiles.
> Q-Q plot: diagnostic plot to check if the distribution of our data follows the assumed distribution.
> Center of gravity: changes in gravity center in West-East direction (left) and South-North (rigth).
