New results with a grid that covers the whole area (I had to reduce the number of knots to 25 to be able to run it in my computer).
You will find too that the Density plot has a legend now.
In addition, I also explored how the results would look like by adding sea surface temperature (results on temperature folder) 
and surface chlorophyll (Chlorophyll folder). Running also these same models but with the quadratic effect.

The model confguration reamins the same: an autoregressive structure for spatiotemporal process (useful when areas some areas are not sampled in every yer))a
and an autoregressive structure on intercepts (useful to interpolate into years when data are not available).

The explanation for each plot remains as before:

> Diag--Encounter_prob: to check whether observed encounter frequencies are within the 95% predictive 
  interval for predicted encounter probability.
> Effective area: range expansion/contraction
> Index biomass: changes in abundances. This plot needs to be readjusted, since we are not using catches but densities.
> Output aniso: I don't know how to interpret this.
> OutputDens_legend: predictive densities per each year. 
> Posterior predictive: diagnostic plot for convergence.
> Posterior predictive histogram: the distribution of the predictions.
> Q-Q hist: the distribution of the quantiles.
> Q-Q plot: diagnostic plot to check if the distribution of our data follows the assumed distribution.
> Center of gravity: changes in gravity center in West-East direction (left) and South-North (rigth).

Details on model configuration can be found in parameter_estimation file and records.
