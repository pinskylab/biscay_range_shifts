New results with a grid that covers the whole area and whose cell size now is 0.1ยบ X 0.1ยบ (about 11km x 11km).
You will find too that the Density plot has a legend now.
In addition, I also explored how the results would look by adding sea surface temperature (results on temperature folder) 
and surface chlorophyll (Chlorophyll folder). I'm also running these same models with the quadratic effect.

The model confguration reamins the same: an autoregressive structure for spatiotemporal process (useful when areas some areas
are not sampled in every yer) and an autoregressive structure on intercepts (useful to interpolate into years when data are 
not available). Number of knots has been reduced to 25 to be able to run it in my computer.

The explanation for each plot remains as before:

> Diag--Encounter_prob: to check whether observed encounter frequencies are within the 95% predictive 
  interval for predicted encounter probability.
> Effective area: range expansion/contraction
> Index biomass: changes in abundances. This plot needs to be readjusted, since we are not using catches but densities.
> Output aniso: I don't know how to interpret this.
> OutputDens_legend: predictive densities per each year. 
> Posterior predictive: diagnostic plot for convergence.
> Posterior predictive histogram: the distribution of the predictions.
> Q-Q hist: the distribution of the quantiles.
> Q-Q plot: diagnostic plot to check if the distribution of our data follows the assumed distribution.
> Center of gravity: changes in gravity center in West-East direction (left) and South-North (rigth).

Details on model configuration can be found in parameter_estimation file and records.
