New results with a grid that covers the whole area and whose cell size now is 0.1ยบ X 0.1ยบ (about 11km x 11km).
You will find too that the Density plot has a legend now.
In addition, I have also tried addinbg sea surface temperature (results on temperature folder), surface chlorophyll (Chlorophyll folder)
and NAO index (Temperature and Chl were extracted from Copernicus, and they were only available since 1992, so all models comprise data 
from 1992 to 2017 now). The AIC changes for every model but the plots look very similar (higher abundances with T and Chl, but similar trends).

The model confguration remains the same for this case: an autoregressive structure for spatiotemporal process (useful when areas some areas
are not sampled in every yer) and an autoregressive structure on intercepts (useful to interpolate into years when data are 
not available). Number of knots has been reduced to 25 to be able to run it in my computer.

The explanation for each plot remains as before:

> Diag--Encounter_prob: to check whether observed encounter frequencies are within the 95% predictive 
  interval for predicted encounter probability.
> Effective area: range expansion/contraction
> Index biomass: changes in abundances. This plot needs to be readjusted, since we are not using catches but densities.
> Output aniso: I don't know how to interpret this.
> OutputDens_legend: predictive densities per each year. 
> Posterior predictive: diagnostic plot for convergence.
> Posterior predictive histogram: the distribution of the predictions.
> Q-Q hist: the distribution of the quantiles.
> Q-Q plot: diagnostic plot to check if the distribution of our data follows the assumed distribution.
> Center of gravity: changes in gravity center in West-East direction (left) and South-North (rigth).

Details on model configuration can be found in parameter_estimation file and settings.
