Model including the quadratic effect of surface temperature (first 10m). Temperatures up to 200m also availabe (pdf attached); in fact, 
a model to select best range of temperature could be done but by the moment I decided to try with surface values.

The model configuration can be checked in settings. 
The AIC can be checked in parameters estimates (Î”AIC smaller than 2)
For covariates, Xconfig_zcp[z,c,p]=1 was used.

The explanation for each plot remains as before:

> Diag--Encounter_prob: to check whether observed encounter frequencies are within the 95% predictive 
  interval for predicted encounter probability.
> Effective area: range expansion/contraction
> Index biomass: changes in abundances. This plot needs to be readjusted, since we are not using catches but densities.
> Median.Temp: plot showing the annual temperature value across years.
> Output aniso: I don't know how to interpret this.
> OutputDens_legend: predictive densities per each year. 
> Posterior predictive: diagnostic plot for convergence.
> Posterior predictive histogram: the distribution of the predictions.
> Q-Q hist: the distribution of the quantiles.
> Q-Q plot: diagnostic plot to check if the distribution of our data follows the assumed distribution.
> Center of gravity: changes in gravity center in West-East direction (left) and South-North (rigth).
