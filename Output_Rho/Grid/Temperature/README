Model including the quadratic effect of surface temperature (first 10m). Temperatures up to 200m also availabe; in fact, 
a model to select best range of temperature could be done but by the moment I decided to try with surface values.
Î”AIC smaller than 2. 

The model configuration can be checked in settings. 
For covariates, Xconfig_zcp[z,c,p]=1 was used.
